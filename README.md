# Rhombix-Technologies_DATA-PREPROCESSING
# Project Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamental steps involved in **data preprocessing**, an essential phase in any machine learning workflow. Good preprocessing ensures that the dataset is clean, consistent, and suitable for building reliable models.

---

## In this project, we focus on:

- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (Normalization and Standardization)
- Splitting datasets into training and testing sets
---
## 🔧 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing and model selection
---
## 📈 Why Data Preprocessing?

Raw data often contains noise, missing values, or inconsistent formats. Preprocessing transforms this messy data into a structured format, allowing machine learning algorithms to perform better and produce more accurate results.

## 🛠️ Key Techniques Covered

- **Missing Value Treatment**: Filling or removing missing values appropriately.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applying `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` techniques.
- **Data Splitting**: Dividing data into training and testing sets for model validation.
